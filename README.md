Late Submissions
In   general,assignments   must   be   submitted   by   the   due   date   to   receive   full   credit.Late   work   is accepted only at the discretion   of the   instructor and   may   not   be   for   full   credit.Keep   in   mind   that   if   you   get   behind   in your work,it   may   become   increasingly difficult to catch   up   as   many   assignments   build on   previous   assignments. As   a   result,late   assignments   may   impact   your   ability   to   successfully complete   the   course. Additionally,some   assignments   require   students   to work   collaboratively   to support   each other's   learning,and therefore submitting your work   late   will   diminish   or   eliminate   the   value   of that work   and   affect   other   students. Your   success   in   this   course   is   important,consult with   your   instructor early   if you   have circumstances or concerns that   are   affecting your   performance.
